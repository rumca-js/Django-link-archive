Google Search Is Dying [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)

## Myth #1 "You only use the first entry in the google search"

If I write "Apple", "Microsoft", "Samsung", "Elon Musk", "Bill Gates", "Love", or 'War', or 'Abortion' I would expect thousands upon thausands of results.

I would like results from CNN, from Fox news, from left, from right, from extremists, from liberals.

There seems to be no filter, no option in Google Search to go beyond the several pages of results.

## Myth #2 Google, YouTube, TikTok algorithms provide what is best for you

Corporations monetize your attention. Their goal is to offer you the most distracting, most addictive content.

Algorithms are set to benefit investors of companies, not the users.

Most of algorithms, like YouTubes's, are based on engagment, on what keeps you hooked. These are not designed to create a well structured database of information. Most do not operate as Wikipedia, but operate as a media outlet. It suggests more 'recent' news, reactions, opinions. It does not propagate scientific news, or data.

## But Google algorithm is the best!

Nothing in this world is permament. What about monopoly? When a company reaches a state where there is no competition, then it often stagnates, and does not evolve.

Google is the unbeated search engine. It can lower lower quality of the services, and noone will be able to switch to alternatives.

If Google, maybe because of some sort of bug, makes search awfully worse for results for pages 2,3, and later, who will find the bug? Will anybody care?

## YouTube comments

YouTube does not allow the user to specify links in comments, possibly to protect the user from spammers. That means we cannot use links any longer, because some of users are abusing this system. Rather than correctly filter out spammers, posting links has been prohibited.

## Searching for trailers

I have found some scenarios in which I was able to receive better results for trailers

When I search for "Trailer" youtube:
 - suggests games, movies, various things. I can apply some filters, I can select expected duration, upload date. I cannot filter game trailers vs movie trailers.
At my setup I can filter by a source type and subtype. At my setup I have category "YouTube" and subcategory "Movies", and "Games".
 - suggests using it's own criteria. At this engine I can browse by date, to see which trailers are 'new' and which are not
 - some trailers are suggested several times at youtube, from various channels. At my setup I have only several youtube channels, which does not spam with same trailers

## Social media

If a social media platform decides to create a space for everybody, then it needs to have some sort of guidelines, but:
 - the guidelines need to be vague enough, to give moderators leeway to moderate anybody
 - the guidelines need to apply to everybody. It is like to have a big family, and you want to make everybody happy. It won't happen. Therefore you need to cater for most of them, and ignore some of other people
 - to be able to deflect any form of criticism there needs to be some sort of virtues established, and people need to be shamed, for not worshiping those virtues. These virtues might be imaginary, not scientific, might be totally pollitically motivated. It does not matter. People may recognize sincerity though. Therefore nearly all social media experience will result in hypocrisy
 - investors of social media are big corporations, therefore social media platform must appear as 'well behaving' for investors. Therefore any form of controversy is not allowed. All views must allign with views of investors, for the monetization of creators to happen

## Social platform recommendation is based on a social score

Sure we criticise China social credit score, but we are not aware we already have such system operating in our place. YouTube, or Google already decides what can be said, and what cannot be.

However that may lead to:
 - suppression of controvertial views
 - boring Internet experience

The moderation however needs to happen, as Internet is full of extremists, trolls, sociopaths.

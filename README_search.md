# Myths and legends

I wanted to disarm some of the most common myths and legends concerning the search algorithms.

## Myth #1 "You only use the first entry in the google search"

It may be mostly true. Recently I wanted to find interesting trailers in YouTube. I wrote "trailer" in the youtube phone app.

In response I found:
 - some videos that I have already watched, which were not trailer related,
 - advertisments
 - some tech trailers, not movie trailers
 - some shorts vidoes
 - some trailers popped up several times, from several different channels, bloating the result

In my app I can add sources I am interested in. For 'trailer' example, I can limit results to 'KinoCheck' source, where I can see all trailers from their history.

## Myth #2 You do not need several pages of results in google search

If I write 'love', or 'war', or 'apple' I would expect thousands upon thausands of results.

## Myth #3 Google, YouTube, TikTok algorithms provide what is best for you

Corporations monetize your attention. Their goal is to offer you the most distracting, most addictive content.

Algorithms are set to benefit investors of companies, not the users.

# Why this happened

Google Search Is Dying [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)

## Inspirations

 - I Tracked Everything I Read on the Internet for a Year [https://www.tdpain.net/blog/a-year-of-reading](https://www.tdpain.net/blog/a-year-of-reading).
 - Automating a Reading List [https://zanshin.net/2022/09/11/automating-a-reading-list/](https://zanshin.net/2022/09/11/automating-a-reading-list/)
 - Luke Smith: Search Engines are Totally Useless Now... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8P6MTOQlyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8P6MTOQlyk)
 - Luke Smith: Remember to Consoom Next Content on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI). As a society we provide news instead of building a data base of important information

## Myth #1 "You only use the first entry in the google search"

If I write "Apple", "Microsoft", "Samsung", "Elon Musk", "Bill Gates", "Love", or 'War', or 'Abortion' I would expect thousands upon thausands of results.

I would like results from CNN, from Fox news, from left, from right, from extremists, from liberals.

There seems to be no filter, no option in Google Search to go beyond the several pages of results (31 pages for 'News' filter). It is a very small number. It is like looking through keyhole at the Internet

## Myth #2 Google, YouTube, TikTok algorithms provide what is best for you

Corporations monetize your attention. Their goal is to offer you the most distracting, most addictive content.

Algorithms are set to benefit investors of companies, not the users.

Most of algorithms, like YouTubes's, are based on engagment, on what keeps you hooked. These are not designed to create a well structured database of information. Most do not operate as Wikipedia, but operate as a media outlet. It suggests more 'recent' news, reactions, opinions. It does not propagate scientific news, or data.

## But Google algorithm is the best!

The algorithm could have been the best 10 years ago, but is it the best righ now?

For example Google, after reaching state of monopoly, could lower it's quality. Will people be able to find out about that?

If Google decreased quality of found entries after the first page. Will anybody be able to find out about that?

Nothing in this world is permament. What about monopoly? When a company reaches a state where there is no competition, then it often stagnates, and does not evolve, or worse, it could lowever quality of their service?

## Conflict of interests

Platforms have investors, and users. It must cater to both: investors and users. Some of interests are mutually exclusive. Are platforms more motivated to cater for big corporations, or to the users?

Can platforms walk between those lines successfully?

## Small creators discovery

Google search algorithms are not that great to see new creators online.

TikTok is able to show new users data very easily. YouTube also shows viedos from new creators. What about Google search? Does not show new blogs?

Most of Google results go towards Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit etc. etc. That is where the investors maney's at.

## Recommendations are based on a social score

Sure, we criticise China social credit score, but we already live in such system. Many of the platforms keep information about users, like 'karma'. Essentially it is a social score, and that is not a bad thing.

In a place with multiple users you need to decide which users are bad actors, which are trolls, and which are just normal users. Moderation needs to happen.

The problem rises, when
 - an elite, maybe moderators twist idea of what is accepted and not accepted on platform
 - contents is politically censored, motivated, or platforms starts spreading political propaganda

I have some questions about that model:
 - Will people be able to find out that the 'truth' visible on a platform is twisted? Are social platforms smart enough to be able to hide proof of any misdoings?
 - Will people be shadowbanned for inconvenient opinions?

## Google is for SEO not for discovery

You cannot effectively "Find new content" on Google. You may be searching for something particular, it will find you that.

For example: you cannot find new blogs, creators by Google.

## YouTube comments

YouTube does not allow the user to specify links in comments, possibly to protect the user from spammers. That means we cannot use links any longer, because some of users are abusing this system. Rather than correctly filter out spammers, posting links has been prohibited.

## YouTube subscriptions

Is very limited. Cannot be used effectively if a source with many videos per day. You will be swampted by a such subscription.

You cannot filter out certain channels from subscriptions.

## Platform guidelines

For social media platform to operate it needs some guidelines, but:
 - the guidelines need to be vague enough, to give moderators leeway to moderate anybody (for example moderator can ban somebody because of 'hate speech' argument. However often it is not written what exactly hate speech is)
 - the guidelines need to apply to everybody. It is like to have a big family, and you want to make everybody happy. It won't happen. Therefore you need to cater for most of them, and ignore some of other people
 - because guidelines decide what is 'acceptable' and 'not acceptable' it establishes verbose, or not verbose set of rules. It establishes some sort of morality, and things it considers 'virtues'. It also needs some sort of "Goldstein" personality. Something for the people to understand what is bad, what not to follow. These virtues might be imaginary, not scientific. Social platforms are big enough just to force their opinions

This may lead to:
 - suppression of controvertial views
 - boring Internet experience

Who controls social media, if their guidelines are moral and correctly implemented?

## Searching for trailers

I have found some scenarios in which I was able to receive better results for trailers

When I search for "Trailer" youtube:
 - suggests games, movies, various things. I can apply some filters, I can select expected duration, upload date. I cannot filter game trailers vs movie trailers.
At my setup I can filter by a source type and subtype. At my setup I have category "YouTube" and subcategory "Movies", and "Games".
 - suggests using it's own criteria. At this engine I can browse by date, to see which trailers are 'new' and which are not
 - some trailers are suggested several times at youtube, from various channels. At my setup I have only several youtube channels, which does not spam with same trailers

## Domains

When browsing the internet much of stuff is hosted somewhere. Today I found multiple things hosted on github. A thought occurred: this is not hosted by individuals, therefore it is 'a property' by github, and 'is managed' by github.

## Self hosting

 - a Small company cannot compete with Google at search. Single user cannot host their own engine
 - In self hosting you can be swamped with data, which you will not be able to filter
 - Link rot is real, it is hard to keep up, with what is maintained
 - How to filter sources at self hosting? Which RSS sources are important, and which are not?

# Data analysis

Propositions for data analysis. There are many things we can do with so much data.

 - Verify link rot, by checking how many pages are still present
 - Capture small creators, which are quoted quite often (filter mainstream media first)
 - Iterate over links, and check which links are quoted often, maintain network identification. Propose a 'karma' for a link, check which links are most influential

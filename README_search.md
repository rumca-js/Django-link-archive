# Why this project started

Google Search Is Dying [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)

 - If we cannot rely on Google to find stuff we need some alternatives
 - I started collecting links using RSS sources - see below

## Inspirations

 - Luke Smith: Remember to Consoom Next Content on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI). As a society we provide news instead of building a data base of important information

## Myth #1 "You only use the first entry in the google search"

If I write "Apple", "Microsoft", "Samsung", "Elon Musk", "Bill Gates", "Love", or 'War', or 'Abortion' I would expect thousands upon thausands of results.

Google provides around 10 to 17 pages, each containing around 10 links each. This gives us 100 to 170 links per search. It is like looking through keyhole at the Internet.

For other filters like 'news' this number can be changed. The number of results is closer to 31 pages.

## Myth #2 Google, YouTube, TikTok algorithms provide what is best for you

Corporations monetize your attention. Their goal is to offer you the most distracting, most addictive content.

Algorithms are set to benefit investors of companies, not the users.

Most of algorithms, like YouTubes's, are based on engagment, on what keeps you hooked. These are not designed to create a well structured database of important information.

Therefore you will not receive important information, but addictive content.

Most do not operate as Wikipedia, but operate as a media outlet. It suggests more 'recent' news, reactions, opinions. It does not propagate scientific news, or data.

## But Google algorithm is the best!

The Google search algorithm could have been the best 10 years ago, but is it the best righ now?

Could it change it's algorithm during period of 10 years? Could it downgrade the experience to boost their sales, or clicks to Google provided services?

Will people be able ever to find out about big tech algorithm manipulations?

If Google decreased quality of found entries after the first page. Will anybody be able to find out about that?

## Conflict of interests

Platforms need to serve investors and users. These interests are sometimes mutually exclusive.

Are platforms more motivated to cater for big corporations, or to the users? How much can they degrade user experience, until users flee to other services?

Can platforms walk between this line successfully?

Will big tech provide content you need, or content advertisers wish to be sold?

## Discovery

Let's say I am interested in blogs. I can search for a blogs, but as a result as I already wrote I will receive around 100 - 200 links. That is a very small number blogs. There are thousands of blogs.

Let's compare that to YouTube. If I search for something I will receive a very long list. As a bonus I have access to reccommended, or similar videos.

When I browse for web, all I can do is to find other sources like reddit to find that information. Therefore I have to write as a search "Best blogs", or "Best blogs reddit".

## Moderation

There always need to be some sort of social media moderation. There are pages designed for devious acts, to spread malware, for espionage, for disinformation.

There are also pages designed by small creators who will be blocked because of some arbitrary reasons, or by a mistake.

There is also a possibility of big tech censorship, where some topics will be muted by Google, Apple, and Facebook because are politicised.

Who and why decides what exists on the Internet?

Is 'Oversight board' in a company enough? In society we have three forms of power: legislature, an executive, and a judicary. It seems that for the Internet a company providing platform has all the power in hand. It decides what is information, and makes the action.

Too much power in one hand leads to abuse of power.

## Platform guidelines

Social media platforms need guidelines, but:
 - The guidelines are often vague enough, to give moderators leeway to moderate anybody (for example moderator can ban somebody because of 'hate speech' argument. However often it is not written what exactly hate speech is)
 - The guidelines use minimal common denominator. It is like to have a big family, and you want to make everybody happy. It won't happen. Therefore you need to cater for most of them, and ignore some of other people

This may lead to:
 - suppression of controvertial views
 - boring Internet experience

## Content property rights

When using github you do not own your code. When creating a YouTube channel you do not own your videos.

The company can take down any videos they do not like.

Like it or leave.

YouTube is nearly monopolistic in it's space, so there is no going around it.

## YouTube comments

Comments are designed for short form discussions. Everything is contained by small boxes, for mobile input. This results in short bursts of emotions, rather than rational discussion.

Secondly YouTube does not allow the user to specify links in comments, possibly to protect the user from spammers. That means we cannot use links any longer, because some of users are abusing this system. Rather than correctly filter out spammers, posting links has been prohibited.

## YouTube subscriptions

YouTube subscription page cannot be used effectively used. Especially if you have more than 30 channels subscribed. The subscription page is easily swampted by videos of the configured channels.

You cannot filter this view at all. What if I want to view only gaming channels? What if I have 'more important' channels which I want to check regularly?

# Examples

## YouTube search just does not work

Finding older trailers in YouTube does not work wery well. If I write 'trailers' I am swamped only with new trailers.

When I search for a "trailer" youtube:
 - suggests games, movies, various things. Filtering is limited to expected duration, upload date. I cannot filter game trailers vs movie trailers.
 - there are many ads in search now
 - some trailers are suggested several times at youtube, from various channels. At my setup I have only several youtube channels, which does not spam with same trailers

## Google search just does not work

If if search for "Minecraft" I will have problem finding pages about individual mods, launchers. I will be directed toward news farms, to YouTube videos.

To find interesting contents about amiga I had to add "fanpage" or "fan site" texts to search prompt.

If I type "operating system" I will be directed toward tech news sites instead of producing me a list of links leading directly to operating systems.

## Self hosting

 - a Small company cannot compete with Google at search. Single user cannot host their own engine
 - In self hosting you can be swamped with data, which you will not be able to filter
 - Link rot is real, it is hard to keep up, with what is maintained
 - How to filter sources at self hosting? Which RSS sources are important, and which are not?

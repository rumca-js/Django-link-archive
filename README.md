## Inspirations

 - I Tracked Everything I Read on the Internet for a Year [https://www.tdpain.net/blog/a-year-of-reading](https://www.tdpain.net/blog/a-year-of-reading).
 - Automating a Reading List [https://zanshin.net/2022/09/11/automating-a-reading-list/](https://zanshin.net/2022/09/11/automating-a-reading-list/)
 - Google Search Is Dying [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)
 - Luke Smith: Remember to Consoom Next Content on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3GVw2JSEI). As a society we provide news instead of building a data base of important information
 - Bright Insight: YES, They Really Are Deleting the Internet And itâ€™s WAY Worse Than You Think [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_NvPpbsbw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_NvPpbsbw). Data are removed from 'visibility' in Google and other platforms.

Reasoning in Polish:

# Problems, notes

 - Google fails to deliver content of small creators (blogs etc. private pages). Google focuses on corporate hosting. Most common links are towards YouTube, Google maps, Facebook, reddit
 - We cannot replace Google search
 - Google provides only 31 pages of news (in news filter) and around 10 pages for ordinary search. This is a very small number. It is like looking through keyhole at the Internet
 - Link rot is real. My links may be not working after some time
 - Is the data relevant, or useful for anyone?
 - Either we would like to record data from 'well established sources' or gather as many links as possible. I think web engines do it? We cannot gather too much data, as it can destroy our potato servers.
 - there are other RSS solutions like 'feedly', but it is an app, not data. You cannot parse it, you do not own the data, you can only do things that feedly allows you to do

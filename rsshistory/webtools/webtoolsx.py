#1
Do not harm anyone. Write ethical programs, and scrapers.

#2
By default SSL verification is disabled. Speeds up processing. At least in my experience.

SSL is mostly important for interacting with pages, not when web scraping. I think. I am not an expert.

#3
If SSL verification is disabled you can see contents of your own domain:
https://support.bunny.net/hc/en-us/articles/360017484759-The-CDN-URLs-are-returning-redirects-back-to-my-domain

Other notes:
 - Sometimes we see the CDN URLs return a 301 redirect back to your own website.
   Usually, when this happens, it's caused by a misconfiguration of your origin server and the origin URL of your pull zone. If the origin URL sends back a redirect, our servers will simply forward that to the user.
 - 403 status code means that your user agent is incorrect / prohibited
 - other statuses can also mean that your user agent is rejected (rarely / edge cases)
 - content-type in headers can be incorrectly set. Found one RSS file that had "text/html"
 - I rely on tools. Those tools have problems/issues. Either we can live with that, or you would have to implement every dependency

TODO:
    - selenium and other drivers should be created once, then only asked for urls. Currently they are re-created each time we ask for a page
    - currently there is a hard limit for file size. If page is too big, it is just skipped
    - we should check meta info before obtaining entire file. Currently it is not done so. Encoding may be read from file, in some cases
    - maybe lists of mainstream media, or link services could be each in one class. Configurable, so that it can be overriden

Main classes are:
    - Url - most things should be done through it
    - PageOptions - upper layers should decide how a page should be called. Supplied to Url
    - PageRequestObject - request
    - PageResponseObject - page response, interface for all implementations

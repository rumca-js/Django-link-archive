# Ideas

We can do much more! We can check and analyse much more!

 - analysis of links: how many of old links are not any longer valid
 - analysis of RSS source: how often it publishes data
 - analysis of RSS source: what kind of data it produces, is it reliable
 - analysis of RSS source: is it a content farm, does it contain many links outside of the domain?
 - analysis of domains: is the domain correctly configured?
 - analysis of topics: who was the first to report on certain topic
 - analysis of topics: which source uses which words? For example it seems that left leaning sites, and white leaning sites have a different vocublary. There are different kind of words and ideads in. With this file history, you can analyze which sites have which ideas
